Marstakers is a Defi project built in Smart Contracts on the Binance Blockchain network.
It is designed for investors who want to profit with the least amount of risk. As a result, mars stakers may be one of the
best investment options, as each staker retains control of their investment at all times, which is backed by the MARS
Token (MARS).

Marstakers rewards stakers with its native token, the Mars token, where stakers stake in BNB and receive the Mars
token. Stakers earn 73000 APR in mars tokens, and users receive 2100 APR when they stake mars earned from staking.
Marstakers is designed in such a way that as stakers continue to stake, the price of the mars token rises.
